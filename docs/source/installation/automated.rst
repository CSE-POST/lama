**Your user need to be sudoer.**

Run ::

  $ sudo ./install.sh

Then you just need to answer questions.

If the script crash, you can debug it and propose a pull request or try with manual installation.
For example, if the part with the installation of the FTP server crash you just need to follow the installation for the FTP server.
